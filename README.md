C is often considered one of the most challenging programming languages due to its intricate, low-level operations. Although mastering C programming swiftly is a formidable task, with focused effort, it is entirely feasible to become proficient in the basics within just one week.

## Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of Python is beneficial.
    - We start by comparing Python code snippets with their C counterparts to highlight differences and demonstrate how C underpins Pythonâ€™s functionality.

## Installation (Generated by GPT-4)
- macOS:
    - Install Xcode Command Line Tools: Open Terminal and type xcode-select --install. Follow the prompts to install the command line tools, which will include the GCC compiler necessary for compiling C programs.
    
    - Install Homebrew: Paste `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` in Terminal to install Homebrew.
    
    - Install GCC: After installing Homebrew, type brew install gcc in Terminal to install GCC.

- Windows:
    - Install MinGW:
    
        - Download MinGW from MinGW-w64.

        - Run the installer and follow the instructions, making sure to select the "mingw32-base" package during the installation.

        - Add the MinGW bin directory to your system path. This is typically found in C:\MinGW\bin.
    
    - Verify Installation: Open Command Prompt and type gcc --version to ensure it prints the GCC version.

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
    - Install GCC: Open a terminal and type `sudo apt-get update` followed by `sudo apt-get install build-essential`. This command installs multiple packages including GCC.
    
    - Verify Installation: Type gcc --version in the terminal to check the installed version of GCC.
